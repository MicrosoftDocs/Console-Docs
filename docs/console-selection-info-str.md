# CONSOLE\_SELECTION\_INFO structure

[!INCLUDE [not-recommended-banner](./includes/not-recommended-banner.md)]

Contains information for a console selection.

## Syntax

```C
typedef struct _CONSOLE_SELECTION_INFO {
  DWORD      dwFlags;
  COORD      dwSelectionAnchor;
  SMALL_RECT srSelection;
} CONSOLE_SELECTION_INFO, *PCONSOLE_SELECTION_INFO;
```

## Members

**dwFlags**  
The selection indicator. This member can be one or more of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
|-|-|
| **CONSOLE_MOUSE_DOWN** 0x0008 | Mouse is down. The user is actively adjusting the selection rectangle with a mouse. |
| **CONSOLE_MOUSE_SELECTION** 0x0004 | Selecting with the mouse. If off, the user is operating `conhost.exe` mark mode selection with the keyboard. |
| **CONSOLE_NO_SELECTION** 0x0000 | No selection. |
| **CONSOLE_SELECTION_IN_PROGRESS** 0x0001 | Selection has begun. If a mouse selection, this will typically not occur without the `CONSOLE_SELECTION_NOT_EMPTY` flag. If a keyboard selection, this may occur when mark mode has been entered but the user is still navigating to the initial position. |
| **CONSOLE_SELECTION_NOT_EMPTY** 0x0002 | Selection rectangle not empty. The payload of *dwSelectionAnchor* and *srSelection* are valid.  |

**dwSelectionAnchor**  
A [**COORD**](coord-str.md) structure that specifies the selection anchor, in characters.

**srSelection**  
A [**SMALL\_RECT**](small-rect-str.md) structure that specifies the selection rectangle.

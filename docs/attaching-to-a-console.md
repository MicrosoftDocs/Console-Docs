# Attaching to a Console


A process can use the [**AttachConsole**](attachconsole.md) function to attach to a console. A process can be attached to one console.

A console can have many processes attached to it. To retrieve a list of the processes attached to a console, call the [**GetConsoleProcessList**](getconsoleprocesslist.md) function.

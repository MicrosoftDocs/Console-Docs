> This document describes console platform functionality that is no longer a part of our **[ecosystem roadmap](ecosystem-roadmap)**. We do not recommend using this content in new products, but we will continue to support existing usages for the indefinite future. Our preferred modern solution focuses on **[virtual terminal sequences](console-virtual-terminal-sequences)** for maximum compatibility in cross-platform scenarios. You can find more information about this design decision in our **[classic console vs. virtual terminal](classic-vs-vt)** document.

# Console Process Groups

When a process uses the [**CreateProcess**](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa) function to create a new console process, it can specify the **CREATE\_NEW\_PROCESS\_GROUP** flag to make the new process the root process of a console process group. The process group includes all processes that are descendants of the root process.

A process can use the [**GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent**](generateconsolectrlevent.md) function to send a CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK signal to all processes in a console process group. The signal is only received by those processes in the group that are attached to the same console as the process that called **GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent**.

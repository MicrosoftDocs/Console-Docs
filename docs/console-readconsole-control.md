# CONSOLE\_READCONSOLE\_CONTROL structure

Contains information for a console read operation.

## Syntax

```C
typedef struct _CONSOLE_READCONSOLE_CONTROL {
  ULONG nLength;
  ULONG nInitialChars;
  ULONG dwCtrlWakeupMask;
  ULONG dwControlKeyState;
} CONSOLE_READCONSOLE_CONTROL, *PCONSOLE_READCONSOLE_CONTROL;
```

## Members

**nLength**  
The size of the structure. Set this member to `sizeof(CONSOLE_READCONSOLE_CONTROL)`.

**nInitialChars**  
The number of characters to skip (and thus preserve) before writing newly read input in the buffer passed to the [**ReadConsole**](readconsole.md) function. This value must be less than the *nNumberOfCharsToRead* parameter of the **ReadConsole** function.

**dwCtrlWakeupMask**  
A mask specifying which control characters between `0x00` and `0x1F` should be used to signal that the read is complete. Each bit corresponds to a character with the least significant bit corresponding to `0x00` or `NUL` and the most significant bit corresponding to `0x1F` or `US`. Multiple bits (control characters) can be specified.

**dwControlKeyState**  
The state of the control keys. This member can be one or more of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
|-|-|
| **CAPSLOCK_ON** 0x0080 | The CAPS LOCK light is on. |
| **ENHANCED_KEY** 0x0100 | The key is enhanced. See [remarks](key-event-record-str.md#remarks). |
| **LEFT_ALT_PRESSED** 0x0002 | The left ALT key is pressed. |
| **LEFT_CTRL_PRESSED** 0x0008 | The left CTRL key is pressed. |
| **NUMLOCK_ON** 0x0020 | The NUM LOCK light is on. |
| **RIGHT_ALT_PRESSED** 0x0001 | The right ALT key is pressed. |
| **RIGHT_CTRL_PRESSED** 0x0004 | The right CTRL key is pressed. |
| **SCROLLLOCK_ON** 0x0040 | The SCROLL LOCK light is on. |
| **SHIFT_PRESSED** 0x0010 | The SHIFT key is pressed. |

## Requirements

| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
|-|-|
| Minimum supported client | Windows Vista \[desktop apps only\] |
| Minimum supported server | WindowsÂ Server 2008 \[desktop apps only\] |
| Header | ConsoleApi.h (via WinCon.h, include Windows.h) |

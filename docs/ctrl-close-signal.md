# CTRL+CLOSE Signal

The system generates a CTRL+CLOSE signal when the user closes a console. All processes attached to the console receive the signal, giving each process an opportunity to clean up before termination. When a process receives this signal, the handler function can take one of the following actions after performing any cleanup operations:

- Call [**ExitProcess**](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-exitprocess) to terminate the process.
- Return **FALSE**. If none of the registered handler functions returns **TRUE**, the default handler terminates the process.
- Return **TRUE**. In this case, no other handler functions are called and the process terminates.

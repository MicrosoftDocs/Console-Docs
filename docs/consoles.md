# Consoles

A *console* is an application that provides I/O services to character-mode applications.

A console consists of an input buffer and one or more screen buffers. The *input buffer* contains a queue of input records, each of which contains information about an input event. The input queue always includes key-press and key-release events. It may also include mouse events (pointer movements and button presses and releases) and events during which user actions affect the size of the active screen buffer. A *screen buffer* is a two-dimensional array of character and color data for output in a console window. Any number of processes can share a console.

> [!TIP]
>A broader idea of consoles and how they relate to terminals and command-line client applications can be found in the **[ecosystem roadmap](ecosystem-roadmap.md)**.
